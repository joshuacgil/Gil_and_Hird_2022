# Gil and Hird 2022: multi-omics Canada goose data analysis code
Contained in this reposititory is R code that converts HUMANn2 .TSV files of genefamilies and pathway abundances from HUMANn2 output into R and code for making figures and conducting statistics. 

This also contains datamining python script (generated using jupyter notebook) used for pulling and assigning taxonomic data from HUMANn2 output Uniprot ID lists and MetaCyc pathway tables to extract the associated prokaryotic data.


Code coresponds to the manuscript: "Multi-omics characterization of the Canada goose fecal microbiome reveals selective efficacy of simulated metagenomes: (out for review)
